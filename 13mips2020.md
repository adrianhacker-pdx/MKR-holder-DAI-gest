Greetings reader, both in and outside of the Maker community.  Right now there are a lot of changes that are starting within MakerDAO.  The Foundation has started the two to three year (give or take) process of training and handing the DAO over to the governance community.  After which the Foundation will effectively dissolve or be absorbed into the DAO as elected paid contributors, or a little of both.

The Foundation has originated a framework for the initial proposed governance through a proposal workflow known as MIPs (Maker Improvement Proposals).  The plan, as it stands from a very high level, is to provide the governance community with initial frameworks where needed.  These can be ratified or differing MIPs can be introduced after the community discusses and debates.  Also, practical application and experience will be primary guides delivered to the governance community from the Foundation.  The goal is to leave the community with introductory, robust, alterable where needed, framework for all governance tasks related to a self-sustainable DAO in conjunction with the practical experience of administering these new constructs.

The Maker platform is strong.  Strong execution of technology and a dedicated group between Foundation and governance members has given way to Maker bouncing back very quickly from black Thursday.  Impressive.  This same dedication will be the driving force behind what will be a historic transformation time, both for the DAO and for all of cryptocurrency and DeFi.  

Here is a list of the first thirteen MIPs that introduce governance framework and collateral on-boarding.  You will find the MIP number, title, and link to the forum discussion.  A keen understanding of what is being proposed by all of the community will serve to build a strong DAO, always.  I would be remiss not to take a moment to make a quick reference for those inside the community and those outside looking in.  Book mark this page, copy it into an email, or whatever is easiest for you to be able to get to these informational resources often and easily.
