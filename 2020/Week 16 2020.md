# Big 3 Take-Aways for the Week:

* SCD shutdown is nearing, but not fully finalized for April 24th as previously thought.  Proposed: Activate shutdown spell after a considerable time delay following the executive vote.  This gives stake holders, integration partners, and other affected individuals ample time to make preparations.  This will provide a smooth wind down in knowing a certain date and time of shutdown.  The Maker platform should end SCD gracefully, not by suprise, caught off gaurd, or with unannounced suprises.  The mode and mood of the SCD shutdown does have a PR effect on the MakerDAO image and can affect confidence of many players in the ecosystem.  

* Collateral Risk Modeling: A Deep Dive.  The importance of this topic cannot be emphasized enough.  New and diverse collateral that is prudently risk assessed by "skin in the game" governance is the key to growing MakerDAO.  Everyone needs to know, at the very minimum, theory behind modeling and assessing new collateral types.  Knowing the procedural in's and out's, mechanics, mathematics, statistical analysis tools, putting the pen on the paper, number crunching should be your learning objective.  The risk team is presenting modeling methods to be able to evaluate different collateral types for opening vaults.  A summary is given below, however, there is no substitute for watching ALL the Governance and Risk calls this week.  Be prepared for some pop-quiz items in DAI-gest in the near and forseeable future.

* Expect more than one Governance and Risk call per week to become a regular occurence.  A lot of work is happening.  A lot of changes are coming.  A lot of teaching, listening, learning, asking, and do-ing needs to happen to grow the DAO.  We can all help each other and serve the DAO effectively with those kinds of actions, attitudes, and intentions.   (- Adrian H - The 1st DAI-Lama)
