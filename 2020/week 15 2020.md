# Revisiting GSM / The Dark Fix and Introducing MIP3: Governance Cycle
# MKR Holder DAI-gest: Week 15, 2020
## Governance Recap April 9, 2020

![](https://i.ibb.co/KVkjVvp/daigestfishlarge.png)

Apologies for the late release of this issue.  I try to publish weekly on Friday or Saturday at the latest after the Governance and Risk call.  That will resume this week.

MKR Holder DAI-gest is a weekly Maker governance recap that is written by the community for the community.  The best source of Maker Community information is through active participation and engagement.   This supplemental publication strives to present all relevant facts and remain free of editorial opinion (Big 3 takeaway excepted).  The statements made herein are not the opinions or statements of the Maker Foundation.

# Big 3 Take-Aways for the Week:

*  MIP3 was explained in depth during the governance and risk call.  This lays out a proposal for a governance cycle in which MIPS are introduced, evaluated by the community, moved on for polling then vote, or delayed with lack of voter approval.  The real take away here is that there have been [13 MIPS proposed by the Foundation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-release-of-the-13-initial-maker-improvement-proposals-mips/1915) that you need to stop what you are doing right now, and dive into understanding those as they lay out the initial self-sustaining governance framework and collateral on boarding as the Foundation begins the preparations for handing off the DAO within the next few years.

*  [This presentation gives three models for implementing the Dark Spell fix](https://youtu.be/UvIppQzmFWY?t=1904) take some time to look at the three options that are presented for validation of the legitimacy of the Dark Spell to be implemented to fix a critical bug in the MCD contract.  There is [discussion happening in the forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/revisiting-gsm-delay-dark-spell-social-layer-discussion/1937/6) to read and participate in as well.  

* Activity is ramping up in the community.  Moving forward from the March madness, and with the road map for a self-sustaining DAO beginning to unfold, there is more work, more activity, more discussion happening. This is the time to start being thoughtful in the coordination of tasks.  Think about priorities that are more value added to the stability, security, and evolution of the DAO.  Be informed about changes and issues, participate, and vote if you hold Maker.

Because another release will be happening in just a few days, I will leave it up to you to check in on the forums for signaling issues.  The dispositioned governance agenda can give you a snap shot of what is moving and what is not this week.

## Paying Participants to learn about Cryptocurrency and MakerDAO during the Corona Virus Pandemic

Thanks to a generous grant from MakerDAO, I have begun hosting virtual meet-ups which pay participants 15 Dai to hang out with me on Google Hangouts, learn about cryptocurrency, have a hands on learning lab with the Kovan Test Network, and leave with 15 real Dai.  It isn't a lot, but it is something in this strange time where every little resource counts.  The training is intended for individuals with zero to very little experience with cryptocurrency.  The first session is today, 4/15 and I will be posting the recording in the next day or two in the forums for individuals to check out.  I am hosting MakerDAO 101: Dai and Oasis on 4/18 at 7:00p.m. PST and another Intro to Bitcoin and Ethereum on 4/26 at 3:00p.m. PST

# Weekly Governance and Risk Meeting

* [YouTube Video EP. 85 4/9/20](https://youtu.be/UvIppQzmFWY)

Here is a guide from MakerDAO about becoming involved in Governance.  The meeting is held every Thursday, 17:00 UTC.  During the postmortem and corrective action phase of the recent crypto market prices and resulting fiasco there has been a daily call.  This is expected to drop to two calls over the next week.  Please check the [forums](https://forum.makerdao.com/) for information related to ad-hoc governance and risk calls that may be happening.
