* On-boarding LINK as a new collateral type.
* DeFi Emergency shutdown consortium
* Dark fix - "
* Flip / Flop auction usability

* Precedent for on-chain polling. Signaling started to determine the governance community's feelings about having foundation member proposals require on-chain polling. [The forum thread seems to have died.](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-precedent-for-on-chain-polling/1400)

## Use Bitcoin to Take out a Loan

Right now you can use Eth and BTC to take out loans on the Oasis.app platform at extremely low rates.  We're talking 0-1%.  Certainly industry best for DeFi right now.  To learn how to turn your BTC into wrapped BTC that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain, you can go to [https://www.wbtc.network/](https://www.wbtc.network/).

## Black Thursday Vault Owners and the Report on Black Thursday Events

[There is a thread going here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/black-thursday-vault-owners-report-thread/1566) in the forums for vault holders that were liquidated with zero bids.  Compensation for some of these vaults is in the works.  [The report analyzing black Thursday events](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-mcd-ethereum-system-liquidation-report-and-black-thursday-compensation-analysis/2243) can be found here.  Here is a snipped of the conclusions and recommendations and a big thanks to MakerMan for the undertaking of preparing this report.

[The sequence of Sai shutting down](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/sequential-process-for-scd-shutdown/1823) is discussed here on the forums and looks something like this:  

![Sai Shutdown Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/yB5m2wb/sai.png)

On May 12, 2020 at 16:00UTC Sai will be shutting down completely.  Following a 6 hour cool down period, you can redeem any Sai you have left for Eth at migrate.makerdao.com .

## The Community Structure of MakerDAO for the Uninformed

In the true spirit of decentralization, there is a lot of work that goes on in the MakerDAO system that is done by various groups.  Anyone can get involved.  There are foundation members that are pay-rolled by the MakerDAO Foundation, the founding entity of MakerDAO which is in the process of preparing to dissolve in a few years once a trained and competent "governance community" has been created.  

Governance community refers to the Maker token holders that can vote on and propose various policies for the system.

Community contributors are folks in the community that have a skill set and provide services to the Dao for compensation.  Note: A governance community member can also be a community contributor.  There really is not a set hierarchy other than folks who have been contributors for longer that may shepherd new individuals wishing to contribute.
