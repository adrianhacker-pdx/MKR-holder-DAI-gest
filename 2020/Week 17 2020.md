# Big 3 Take-Aways for the Week:

* Understanding the MIPS framework that is being proposed right now is essential.  It is a lot of information to sort through, so take it in small pieces if that will help you to focus and retain the information.  [Here is a link](https://mkrdai.substack.com/p/mips-0-through-12-index-reference) to an indexed list of all the MIPS (outside the forum). It is the entire framework of an introductory governance framework and collateral onboarding procedures.  You will find the MIP number, title, and sentence summary with a link to the forum discussion.  See below for two additional sub-proposals added to MIPS 0 through 12.

* The state of the peg has caused concern within and without the MakerDAO community.  Some of the larger Maker holders stepped forward and posted thier concerns around the state of the peg directly in the Maker forum.  This spurred a lot of momentum in the platform, discussed further in this issue.

* Intention to implementation.  The DAO is getting very busy, and thought needs to be given to determining the feasibility of proposals, getting buy in and recruiting the appropriate skill sets in the community.  Timing is key.  The DAO is in need of a project management framework that is effortless and easily integrated into the current systems.
